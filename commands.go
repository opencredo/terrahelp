		Name:  "encrypt",
		Usage: "Uses configured provider to encrypt specified content",
		Description: "Using either the 'simple' (default) or 'vault' provider, encrypt will ensure that the relevant content\n" +
			"   is encrypted in either full, or inline mode. You may want to filter out certain sensitive content from the\n" +
			"   output of terraform commands such as a 'terraform plan' or 'terraform apply'. Terrahelp always assumes \n" +
			"   you are piping your content in (for example from stdin) unless you explicitly specify file(s) to read in from \n" +
			"   (and thus also write out to). Either way the encryption process is run over the appropriate content. \n" +
			"   In general it is expected that the following process will occur: \n" +
			"   * The standard terraform commands will be performed i.e. \n" +
			"       terraform plan\n" +
			"       terraform apply\n" +
			"   * Then when happy, the encryption can be applied (for example against the tfstate files) i.e.\n" +
			"       terrahelp encrypt -file=terraform.tfstate -file=terraform.tfstate.backup  \n" +
			"   * Finally, if required, these files can then be checked in to version control.\n\n" +
			"   The desired 'provider' and well as 'mode' can be supplied as CLI arguments, or via the TH_ENCRYPTION_PROVIDER \n" +
			"   and TH_ENCRYPTION_MODE environment variables. Encrypted values will always conform to the following format: \n" +
			"   @terrahelp-encrypted(ENCRYPTED_CONTENT). Decryption essentially operates in reverse. \n\n" +

			"   Encryption modes: full,inline  \n" +
			"   -----------------------------  \n" +
			"   The default encryption mode is 'full' which means the full content (of for example the .tfstate files) \n" +
			"   will be encrypted. Quite often however it is desirable to only encrypt certain sensitive fragments within \n" +
			"   the data, and not simply the whole content as a single unit and this is where the inline mode comes in. \n" +
			"   Inline encrypting works by detecting sensitive values within the state files and then replaces them with \n" +
			"   encrypted values. Terrahelp assumes all sensitive values are defined as values within the terraform.tfvars \n" +
			"   file, which just by way of recap should NEVER be checked into version control! Terrahelp then uses the  \n" +
			"   terraform.tfvars file to identify which values are considered sensitive, searches for any occurrence \n" +
			"   of these values within the provided content and essentially does a find and replace of all the sensitive values \n" +
			"   with appropriately encrypted ones. \n\n" +

			"   Providers: simple,vault,vault-cli \n" +
			"   ---------------------------------  \n" +
			"     * 'simple' provider: \n" +
			"         NOTE: Any arguments specifically related to the simple provider will always have a simple-xxx prefix.   \n" +
			"         This provider performs simple in memory AES encryption, and requires that you pass in either a 16 or 32 \n" +
			"         character key to indicate if you want 128 or 256 bit AES encryption. For example a key with value \n" +
			"         'AES256Key-32Characters0987654321' will result in your content being encrypted with 256 bit AES encryption. \n" +
			"         Note: If you lose access to this encryption key, you will NOT be able to decrypt these values!!\n\n" +

			"     * 'vault' provider (https://www.vaultproject.io): \n" +
			"         NOTE: Any arguments specifically related to the vault provider will always have a vault-xxx prefix.   \n" +
			"         This version of the vault provider expects a running and accessible instance of Vault to be available \n" +
			"         and to have access to it via its http API. Currently validated against Vault 0.5.2 \n\n" +

			"         It is configured via standard Vault environment variables i.e.  \n" +
			"           export VAULT_TOKEN=your-vault-root-token \n" +
			"           export VAULT_ADDR=http://127.0.0.1:8200\n" +
			"           export VAULT_SKIP_VERIFY=true\n\n" +

			"         Vault's transit aka 'encryption as a service' feature is then used to offload and perform the actual \n" +
			"         encryption. (https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/transit). The Vault transit backend makes use \n" +
			"         of a registered named encryption key to gain access to the underlying encryption key itself, as well \n" +
			"         details about what encryption algorithm to use. This encrypt command expects you to have \n" +
			"         already setup and registered a named encryption key which will be used here. If not explicitly\n" +
			"         specified, then 'terrahelp' i.e. /transit/key/terrahelp is assumed as default. Note you can use the \n" +
			"         terrahelp vault-autoconfig command to auto register and generate a new key against this default \n" +
			"         named key for you if not already done. \n\n" +

			"     * 'vault-cli' provider: \n" +
			"         This version of the Vault provider relies on direct access to the Vault CLI (as opposed to accessing \n" +
			"         Vault via its HTTP API alone). It is however configured, and works, in the same way the vault provider \n" +
			"         described above, with the exception you will also need the Vault CLI to be available in the PATH\n" +

			"   EXIT STATUS \n" +
			"   ----------- \n" +
			"   The encrypt command exits with one of the following values: \n" +
			"        0     Encryption succeeded. \n" +
			"        1     Error encrypting due to terrahelp wrapper issues or violations (e.g. double encrypt not permitted). \n" +
			"        >1    Any other error occurred. \n\n" +
